/* 1. Change the color of all list items inside an unordered list */

/* Use a descendant selector. The following rule will select all li elements within a  ul element
even if it's 3 or 4 levels deep. This is in constrast to

ul > li which will only select the direct child of a ul

See https://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/ for good discussion.

CSS Combinator: What is it? A combinator explains the relationship between the selector. There are 4 in CSS:
1. descendant selector (space) -- matches ALL descendant selectors, so be careful that's what you intend!
2. child selector (>) -- selects immediate children
3. adjacent sibling (+) -- selects the sibling that immediately follows
4. general sibling (~) -- selects all siblings that are below it in the document

ul li { color: orange; }

/* 2. Remove the text decoration from navigation links, and change their color when hovered */

Link Pseudo-Classes in Order
It's also useful to know that most of the link pseudo-classes should be declared in a specific order. The order is: Link, Visited, Hover, Active. If you're including :focus styling for your link, it's common to add it between "hover" and "active".

*/
nav a:link {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: deepskyblue;
}

nav a:visited {
    color: tomato;
}

nav a:hover {
    color: darkblue;
    font-weight: 700;
}

/*
If you need focus, put it here!

nav a:focus {*/
    /*color: aqua;*/
/*}*/

nav a:active {
    color: darkblue;
}

/* 3. Create hover and visited styles for all links inside 'main'

   Link Pseudo-Classes (In Order)
   link, visited, hover, active
   l, v, h, a
   love, hate */

main a:link { color: deepskyblue; }
main a:visited { color: tomato; }
main a:hover { color: darkblue; }


/* 4. Change the background color of the submit button when active */
input[type="submit"]:active {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
}


/* Give the text field a blue border upon focus */
input[type="text"]:focus {
    background-color: blue;
}

/* Give the 'span' tag in the footer a meaningful class name and reduce its font size */
.copyright {
    font-size: 0.9em;
}


/* Give the 'img' tag in the header an ID and set its width to 190px */
#header-img {
    width: 190px;
}


/* Target all heading tags on the page and set their font family to 'Bree Serif', serif */
h1,
h2,
h3 {
    font-family: 'Bree Serif', serif;
}
